//! Functions for generating Minecraft commands that produce [LogEvent](crate::log::LogEvent)s.
//!
//! [LogEvents](crate::log::LogEvent) are only produced when the output of a command is written to
//! Minecraft's log file. For this to happen a number of preconditions have to be met:
//! 1. The command has to be executed by a player, command block or command block minecart. The
//!   output of a command executed by a `mcfunction` is never logged.
//! 2. The gamerule `logAdminCommands` has to be `true`. If the command block is executed by a
//!   command block or command block minecart then the gamerule `commandBlockOutput` also has to be
//!   `true`.
//!
//! # Set Gamerules appropriately for Logging
//!
//! It is typically not a good idea to enable the gamerule `commandBlockOutput` for longer than
//! neccessary. The reason for this is that the output of commands is also written to the chat when
//! the gamerule `sendCommandFeedback` is enabled. This will likely annoy players as it makes the
//! chat unusable and causes it to take up a big part of the screen, even when only a single command
//! logs it's output every game tick. So whenever `commandBlockOutput` is enabled,
//! `sendCommandFeedback` should be disabled. But `sendCommandFeedback` should not be disabled for
//! longer than neccessary, because without it players will not get any output from commands they
//! execute.
//!
//! Ideally whenever the output of one or more commands should be logged, the three gamerules should
//! first be set to enable logging without spamming the chat and after the commands are executed,
//! the gamerules should be reset to their previous values to preserve the world configuration. This
//! can be done with [enable_logging_command] and [reset_logging_command].
//!
//! # Logging Command Output from Minecraft Function Files
//!
//! Minect offers two ways to work around the limitation of `mcfunction` files. To log the output of
//! a command from a `mcfunction` file you can either use [logged_block_commands] or a
//! [logged_cart_command].
//!
//! # Common Commands with useful Output
//!
//! Minect offers a few functions to generate commands commonly used to retrieve information from
//! Minecraft. Their output can then be parsed into predefined structs:
//! * [summon_named_entity_command] -> [SummonNamedEntityOutput]
//! * [add_tag_command] -> [AddTagOutput]
//! * [query_scoreboard_command] -> [QueryScoreboardOutput]

/// Generates a Minecraft command that ensures [LogEvent](crate::log::LogEvent)s are created for all
/// commands until a [reset_logging_command] is executed. These two commands are executed
/// automatically by [execute_commands](crate::MinecraftConnection::execute_commands) if
/// [enable_logging_automatically](crate::MinecraftConnectionBuilder::enable_logging_automatically)
/// is `true` (which is the default).
///
/// This command sets the following three gamerules:
/// 1. `logAdminCommands`: This must be `true` for Minecraft to write the output of commands to the
///    log file.
/// 2. `commandBlockOutput`: This must be `true` for command blocks and command block minecarts to
///    broadcast the output of their commands.
/// 3. `sendCommandFeedback`: This is set to `false` to prevent the output to to also be written to
///    the chat which would likely annoy players.
///
/// This changes the logging configuration of the world in such a way that a player does not get any
/// output from any command (including commands the player executes). So the original values of the
/// gamerules are stored and can be restored by executing a [reset_logging_command].
///
/// After executing multiple [enable_logging_command]s, the same number of [reset_logging_command]s
/// has to be executed to reset logging.

/// Generates two Minecraft commands that cause the given command to be executed from a command
/// block. This can be used to log the output of a command when running in a `mcfunction`.
///
/// The two commands are also available individually through [prepare_logged_block_command] and
/// [logged_block_command]. To work properly each [logged_block_command] has to be preceded by a
/// single [prepare_logged_block_command], otherwise it may overwrite a previous command or not be
/// executed at all.
///
/// There are two variants of this function that also define the name of the command block:
/// [named_logged_block_commands] and [json_named_logged_block_commands]. They can be used to allow

/// [MinecraftConnection::add_named_listener](crate::MinecraftConnection::add_named_listener) or

///
/// When the command block executes, the gamerules will be set appropriately for logging. So there
/// is no need to execute an [enable_logging_command] and a [reset_logging_command].
///
/// # Timing
///
/// The command block executes delayed, but it is guaranteed to execute within the same gametick as
/// the `mcfunction` in the following cases:
/// * The `mcfunction` is executed by a `function` command passed to
///   [execute_commands](crate::MinecraftConnection::execute_commands).
/// * The `mcfunction` is executed by a `function` command passed to [logged_block_commands].
/// * The `mcfunction` is executed by a `schedule` command.
///
/// Otherwise the command block may execute in the next game tick. Examples include, but are not
/// limited to:
/// * The `mcfunction` is executed by the function tag `#minecraft:tick`.
/// * The `mcfunction` is executed by a custom command block.
